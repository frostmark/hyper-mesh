In Hyperloop, your ActiveRecord Models are available in your Isomorphic code.

Components, Operations, and Stores have CRUD access to your server side ActiveRecord Models, using the standard ActiveRecord API.

In addition, Hyperloop implements push notifications (via a number of possible technologies) so changes to records on the server are dynamically pushed to all authorized clients.

*It's Isomorphic Ruby in action.*

In other words, one browser creates, updates, or destroys a Model, and the changes are persisted in ActiveRecord models and then broadcast to all other authorized clients.

## Overview

+ The `hyper-model` gem provides ActiveRecord Models to Hyperloop's Isomorphic architecture.
+ You access your Model data in your Components, Operations, and Stores just like you would on the server or in an ERB or HAML view file.
+ If an optional push transport is connected Hyperloop broadcasts any changes made to your ActiveRecord models as they are persisted on the server or updated by one of the authorized clients.
+ Some Models can be designated as *server-only* which means they are not available to the Isomorphic code.

For example, consider a simple model called `Dictionary` which might be part of Wiktionary type app.

```ruby
class Dictionary < ActiveRecord::Base

  # attributes
  #   word: string   
  #   definition: text
  #   pronunciation: string

  scope :defined, -> { 'definition IS NOT NULL AND pronunciation IS NOT NULL' }
end
```

Here is a very simple Hyperloop Component that shows a random word from the dictionary:

```ruby
class WordOfTheDay < Hyperloop::Component

  def pick_entry!  
    # pick a random word and assign the selected record to entry
    @entry = Dictionary.defined.all[rand(Dictionary.defined.count)]
    force_update! # redraw our component when the word changes
    # Notice that we use standard ActiveRecord constructs to select our
    # random entry value
  end

  # pick an initial entry before we mount our component...
  before_mount :pick_entry

  # Again in our render block we use the standard ActiveRecord API, such
  # as the 'defined' scope, and the 'word', 'pronunciation', and
  # 'definition' attribute getters.  
  render(DIV) do
    DIV { "total definitions: #{Dictionary.defined.count}" }
    DIV do
      DIV { @entry.word }
      DIV { @entry.pronunciation }
      DIV { @entry.definition }
      BUTTON { 'pick another' }.on(:click) { pick_entry! }
    end
  end
```

For complete examples with *push* updates, see any of the apps in the `examples` directory, or build your own in 5 minutes following one of the quickstart guides:

+ [Using Simple Polling](/docs/simple_poller_quickstart.md)  

## Basic Installation and Setup

The easiest way to install is to use the `hyper-rails` gem.

TODO check install uses `--hyper-model`

1. Add `gem 'hyper-rails'` to your Rails `Gemfile` development section.
2. Install the Gem: `bundle install`
3. Run the generator: `bundle exec rails g hyperloop:install --hyper-model` (or use `--all` to install all hyperloop gems)
4. Update the bundle: `bundle update`

TODO check validity and ensure generator does this move

You will find a `hyperloop/models` folder has been added to the Rails.  To access a model on the client, move it into the `hyperloop/models` folder.  If you are on Rails 5, you will also need to move the `application_record.rb` into this folder.

You will also find an `app/policies` folder with a simple access policy suited for development.  Policies are how you will provide detailed access control to your Isomorphic models.  More details [here](/docs/authorization-policies.md).

TODO fix link above

To summarize:

+ Your Isomorphic Models are moved to `hyperloop/models`. These are accessible to your Components, Operations, and Stores from either the server or the client.
+ If you need to have server-only Models, they remain in `app/models`. These models are **not** accessible to your Isomorphic code.

## Setting up the Push Transport

To have changes to your Models on the server broadcast to authorized clients, add a Hyperloop initializer file and specify a transport.  For example to setup a simple polled transport add this file:

TODO check below

```ruby
# config/initializers/hyperloop.rb
Hyperloop.configuration do |config|
  config.transport = :simple_poller
end
```

After restarting, and reloading your browsers you will see changes broadcast to the clients.  You can also play with this by firing up a rails console, and creating, changing or destroying Models at the console.

For setting up the other possible transports following one of these guides:

+ [Using Pusher-Faker](/docs/pusher_faker_quickstart.md)
+ [Using Simple Polling](/docs/simple_poller_quickstart.md)

## Advanced Configuration

TODO fix links below

The above guides will work in most cases, but for complete details on configuration settings go [here](/docs/configuration_details.md)

## ActiveRecord API

Hyperloop uses a large subset of the ActiveRecord API, modified only when necessary to accommodate the asynchronous nature of the client.  You can access your ActiveRecord models just like you would in Models, Controllers, or in ERB or HAML view templates.

TODO fix links below

See this [guide](/docs/activerecord_api.md) for details.

**Note** currently the `attributes` method is supported, but please do not use it as some details of the semantics will be changing in an upcoming release.  Instead of `foo.attributes[:xyz]` use `foo.send('xyz')` for now.

## Client Side Scoping

By default scopes will be recalculated on the server.  For simple scopes that do not use joins or includes no additional action needs to be taken to make scopes work with Hyperloop.  For scopes that do use joins, or if you want to offload the scoping computation from the server to the client read more [here.](docs/client_side_scoping.md)

## Authorization

Each application defines a number of *channels* and *authorization policies* for those channels and the data sent over the channels.

Policies are defined with *Policy* classes.  These are similar and compatible with [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) but
you do not need to use the pundit gem (but can if you want.)

TODO fix links below

For complete details see [Authorization Policies](docs/authorization-policies.md)

## Common Errors

- **No policy class**
  If you don't define a policy file, nothing will happen because nothing will get connected. By default Hyperloop will look for a `ApplicationPolicy` class.

- **Wrong version of pusher-fake**  (pusher-fake/base vs. pusher-fake/rspec) See the Pusher-Fake gem repo for details.

- Forgetting to add `require pusher` in application.js file  
this results in an error like this:   
  ```text
  Exception raised while rendering #<TopLevelRailsComponent:0x53e>
      ReferenceError: Pusher is not defined
  ```  
  To resolve make sure you `require 'pusher'` in your application.js file if using pusher.  DO NOT require pusher from your components manifest as this will cause prerendering to fail.

- **No create/update/destroy policies**
  You must explicitly allow changes to the Models to be made by the client. If you don't you will see 500 responses from the server when you try to update. To open all access do this in your application policy: `allow_change(to: :all, on: [:create, :update, :destroy]) { true }`

- **Cannot connect to real pusher account**
  If you are trying to use a real pusher account (not pusher-fake) but see errors like this  
  ```text   
  pusher.self.js?body=1:62 WebSocket connection to
  'wss://127.0.0.1/app/PUSHER_API_KEY?protocol=7&client=js&version=3.0.0&flash=false'
  failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
  ```   
  Check to see if you are including the pusher-fake gem.  
  Hyperloop will always try to use pusher-fake if it sees the gem included.  Remove it and you should be good to go.  See [issue #5](https://github.com/hyper-react/HyperMesh/issues/5) for more details.

- **Cannot connect with ActionCable.**  
  Make sure that `config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins` includes the url you use for development (including the port) and that you are using `Puma`.

- **Attributes are not being converted from strings, or do not have their default values**
Eager loading is probably turned off.  Hyperloop needs to eager load `hyperloop/models` so it can find all the column information for all Isomorphic models.

- **When starting rails you get a message on the rails console `couldn't find file 'browser'`**
The `hyper-component` v0.10.0 gem removed the dependency on opal-browser.  You will have to add the 'opal-browser' gem to your Gemfile.

- **On page load you get a message about super class mismatch for `DummyValue`**
You are still have the old `reactive-record` gem in your Gemfile, remove it from your gemfile and your components manifest.

- **On page load you get a message about no method `session` for `nil`**  
You are still referencing the old reactive-ruby or reactrb gems either directly or indirectly though a gem like reactrb-router.  Replace any gems like `reactrb-router` with `hyper-router`.  You can also just remove `reactrb`, as `hyper-model` will be included by the `hyper-model` gem.

- **You keep seeing the message `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/cable' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established.`** every few seconds in the console.  
  There are probably lots of reasons for this, but it means ActionCable can't get itself going.  One reason is that you are trying to run with Passenger instead of Puma, and trying to use `async` mode in cable.yml file.  `async` mode requires Puma.

## Debugging

Sometimes you need to figure out what connections are available, or what attributes are readable etc.

Its usually all to do with your policies, but perhaps you just need a little investigation.

TODO check rr has become hyperloop (as below)

You can bring up a console within the controller context by browsing `localhost:3000/hyperloop/console`

**Note:  change `rr` to wherever you are mounting Hyperloop in your routes file.**

**Note: in rails 4, you will need to add the gem 'web-console' to your development section**

Within the context you have access to `session.id` and current `acting_user` which you will need, plus some helper methods to reduce typing

- Getting auto connection channels:  
`channels(session_id = session.id, user = acting_user)`  
e.g. `channels` returns all channels connecting to this session and user providing nil as the acting_user will test if connections can be made without there being a logged in user.

- Can a specific class connection be made:
`can_connect?(channel, user = acting_user)`
e.g. `can_connect? Todo`  returns true if current acting_user can connect to the Todo class. You can also provide the class name as a string.

- Can a specific instance connection be made:
`can_connect?(channel, user = acting_user)`
e.g. `can_connect? Todo.first`  returns true if current acting_user can connect to the first Todo Model. You can also provide the instance in the form 'Todo-123'

- What attributes are accessible for a Model instance:  
`viewable_attributes(instance, user = acting_user)`

- Can the attribute be viewed:  
`view_permitted?(instance, attribute, user = acting_user)`

- Can a Model be created/updated/destroyed:
`create_permitted?(instance, user = acting_user)`  
e.g. `create_permitted?(Todo.new, nil)` can anybody save a new todo?  
e.g. `destroy_permitted?(Todo.last)` can the acting_user destroy the last Todo

You can of course simulate server side changes to your Models through this console like any other console.  For example

`Todo.new.save` will broadcast the changes to the Todo Model to any authorized channels.

## Development

`hyper-model` is the merger of `reactive-record`, `synchromesh` and `hyper-mesh` gems.  As such a lot of the internal names are still using either ReactiveRecord or Synchromesh module names.

TODO check below is vstill alid

The original `ReactiveRecord` specs were written in opal-rspec.  These are being migrated to use server rspec with isomorphic helpers.  There are about 170 of the original tests left and to run these you

1. cd to `reactive_record_test_app`
2. do a bundle install/update as needed,
3. `bundle exec rake db:reset db:test:prepare`,
4. start the server: `bundle exec rails s`,
5. then visit `localhost:3000/spec-opal`.

If you want to help **PLEASE** consider spending an hour and migrate a spec file to the new format.  You can find examples by looking in the `spec/reactive_record/` directory and matching to the original file in
`reactive_record_test_app/spec_dont_run/moved_to_main_spec_dir`

The remaining tests are run in the more traditional `bundle exec rake`

or

```
bundle exec rspec spec
```

You can run the specs in firefox by adding `DRIVER=ff` (best for debugging.)  You can add `SHOW_LOGS=true` if running in poltergeist (the default) to see what is going on, but ff is a lot better for debug.
